My personal website.

Built using Bootstrap, with some inspiration from https://jonbarron.info/.

Blogs are rendered using VSCode and the Markdown All in One plugin, with two
additional lines for styling:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="blog_style.css">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
